## Docker based setup for running plex, sonarr and radarr. Downloads handled by transmission through a VPN

Steps:
1. Install docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#platform-support-matrix
1. Install docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/davearata/MediaCenterSetup`
1. Edit $MOUNT_POINT/mp4_automator/autoProcess.ini to your desired settings.
1. `cd ./MediaCenterSetup`
1. Run `LOCAL_NETWORK="192.168.1.0/24" TIME_ZONE="Europe/London" MOUNT_POINT="/mnt/volume-fra1-01" VPN_PROVIDER="NORDVPN" VPN_CONFIG="UK" VPN_USERNAME="username" VPN_PASSWORD="password" docker-compose up -d`
1. Open Jackett http://YOUR_IP:9117/Admin/Dashboard and add a tracker to use, click "Copy torznab feed" and save this for the next step.
1. Open Sonarr http://YOUR_IP:8989/
    1. Add a downloadclient of type transmission. Set the ip and the port is 9091
    1. Add a torznab custom indexer, paste in the torznab feed from the previous step. Also set the API key to the one displayed at the top of Jackett
    1. Click "Connect" and add `Custom Script`. Disable On Grab. The path is /sickbeard_mp4_automator/postSonarr.sh. Leave Arguments empty.
    1. Click "Media Management" tab. Find the button for "Rename Episodes" and turn it on. You can change the naming conventions to whatever you like.
    1. Click _Series_, _Add series_ and find one you want. Click _Add a path_ and set it to `/tv/`
    1. Edit $MOUNT_POINT/mp4_automator/autoProcess.ini with your Sonarr api key
1. Open Radarr http://YOUR_IP:7878/ and repeat the steps for Sonarr, except when you add a path set it to `/movies/`
1. Open Plex http://YOUR_IP:32400/web/index.html and libraries, Movies path is `/data/movies/` and TV path is `/data/tv/`
    1. Edit $MOUNT_POINT/mp4_automator/autoProcess.ini with your Plex token and ip.


Steps:
1. Create a user with priviliges over media and docker folders, and get UID and GID.
1. Install docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#platform-support-matrix
1. Install docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/davearata/MediaCenterSetup`
1. Edit .env to configure environment settings.
1. In Sonarr, Radarr, etc, connect to other services using their name as hostname - e.g. transmission host is transmission.


### Notes
This assumes you have one user who's PGID/PUID is 1000. Change this as needed if you arne't using the first user created

### Problems
For some reason Radarr downloads files though transmission as root rather than as the normal user. So you need to regularily `chown -R user:user $MOUNT_POINT/transmission/completed`, not sure how to fix this.
